                As the third largest ethnic group in Iran, the Kurdish region ofIran spans the areas known as the  Kurdistan Province, KermanshahProvince, West Azerbaijan Province, Ilam Province, and LorestanProvince <a href="Gunter, Michael M.

From the 10th century to the 20th, there haveexisted many minor and major Kurdish dynasties, kingdoms, andcity-states, including the existence of a “Kurdistan” near thecity of Bahar <a href="Sebastian Mastel (2018).

                Before the 20th century, small pockets of Kurdish areasfunctioned autonomously, including the short lived Republic ofMahabad shortly after the Second World War <a href="D. McDowall, A Modern History of the Kurds, I.B. Tauris Publishers, ISBN 978-1-85043-416-0, p. 67">[4]</a>. However, thePersian government has actively taken measures to suppress theKurdish population, to the extent of holding political prisonerswithout a fair trial or legal representation <a href="Romano, David (2006).

                In the 1979 Iranian rebellion against the Shah, Kurdish supporters attemptedto enact more inclusive policies after overthrowing the Shah’srule. While this attempt was not wildly successful, later effortsin the 90s, including nationwide protests for the recognition ofKurds, enabled Kurdish representation in the Persian governmentthrough the election of Kurdish governors and parliament members<a href="A Rise in Nationalism in Eastern Kurdistan. Kurdistan National Assembly. Archived from the original on 2014-09-14. http://www.kurdnas.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=465:a-rise-in-nationalism-in-eastern-kurdistan&catid=36:reports1&Itemid=56">[6]</a>. Despite such developments, tensions between the Persiangovernment and the Kurdish population at large have been highthroughout the last few decades. In the early 2000s, the murderof Kurdish activists by Iranian security forces in the city ofMahabad led to many protests by the Kurdish general population,but also resulted in a tougher crackdown on a number of Kurdishpolitical activists.<br><br>

                In summary, the Kurdish population in Iran is present butsuppressed, despite having a history of smaller Kurdish provincesand states in the distant past.</p>
