                The borders of Western Kurdistan have varied in recent years, although the area is defined more broadly through particular areas in the Jazire Region, Afrin District, and the Euphrates Region. The Kurds in Syria are the largest ethnic minority, comprising an estimated 10% of the country’s population.</p>

                The history of Kurds in Syria during the 20th century can be splitinto two general periods, defined by the formation of an independent Syrian Republic in the 1960s. During the reign of the Ottoman Empire,Kurdish tribal groups functioned with semiautonomy, but did not forma fully recognized Kurdish state. After the First World War, regions in Syria such as the Jazira province saw support for an autonomous Kurdish state, but the Syrian government responded with persecuting many pro-Kurdishsupporters, including revoking citizenship andproperty <a href="D. McDowall, A Modern History of the Kurds, I.B. Tauris Publishers, ISBN 978-1-85043-416-0, p. 43">[1]</a><br><br>
                
                In recent years, the Syrian Civil War and the Rojava revolution has led to the formation of a Kurdish-led autonomous region, which is currently seeing conflict with Turkey after the withdrawal of United States forces in 2019 <a href="Displaced Kurds from Afrin need help, activist says. The Jerusalem Post. 26 March 2018. https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Displaced-Kurds-from-Afrin-need-help-activist-says-547096">[2]</a>.<br><br>
                   
                In summary, the Syrian conflicts have led to the formation of a semi autonomous Kurdish state, but this region is yet to be officially recognized and tensions with Turkey have led to a state of uncertainty for the region’s future.
