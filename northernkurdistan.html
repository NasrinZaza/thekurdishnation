                <p>
                Northern Kurdistan, is one of the most populous Kurdish regions in the Middle East, with 13 of the 81 provinces having Kurdish majorities <a href="https://global.britannica.com/place/Kurdistan">[1]</a>. Due to political tensions and the denial of Kurdish existence by the Turkish government, it is difficult to truly identify the celebration of Kurdish culture, although the region has produced important Kurdish musicians and poets.</p><br><br>

                <h class="sub-heading">Challenges</h>
                
                <p>In terms of challenges, due to Turkification <a href="Kurdish Politics in Turkey: From the PKK to the KCK. Routledge. 2014. ISBN 978-1-317-27116-1.">[2]</a> and the ongoing military and political Kurdish-Turkish conflict, the status of Kurds in this region is dire and ongoing development in Turkish military policies has led to the loss of many Kurdish homes, villages, and lives <a href="Dahlman, Carl. The Political Geography of Kurdistan, Eurasian Geography and Economics, Vol. 43, No. 4, 2002, p.278">[3]</a>.<br><br>
                    
                Although the Kurdish-Turkish conflict has lasted since 1978, the conflict between Kurds and the Turkish government have existed even during the age of the Ottoman Empire. During the 18th and 19th century, Kurdish regions have seen power struggles for decades. In the 1920s and 30s, grassroots Kurdish rebellions were forcefully put down by the Turkish government. Kurdish political parties such as The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) often saw many periods of military conflict. There have been many initiatives and government policies set by the Turkish government to systemically suppress the growth and existence of Kurds, such as banning the use of the Kurdish language and forced immigration of Kurds to other regions in Turkey <a href="IX. RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF THE KURDISH LANGUAGE. www.hrw.org.">[4]</a>. In the early 2000s, when Turkey was to be nominated for joining the EU, there were some improvements and allowances for foreign language; however, much of that policy has been reversed in recent years due to the rise in military aggression by the Turkish military <a href="https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1630&context=masters_theses">[5]</a><br><br> 

                In summary, the Kurdish communities in Turkey are one of the largest, but heavily persecuted, regions of Greater Kurdistan.</p>
