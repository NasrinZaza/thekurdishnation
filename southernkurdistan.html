                Perhaps the most politically recognized region for Kurds, the Constitution of Iraq specifically designates this area as an autonomous region, known as the Kurdistan Region, having their own parliament, borders, foreign policy and armed forces known as the Peshmerga, which translates to: those who stand before death, although this was not achieved without decades of conflict and political revolts <a href="Rafaat, Aram (2018). Kurdistan in Iraq: The Evolution of a Quasi-State. Routledge. p. 132. ISBN 9781351188814.">[1]</a>.</p>

                During the era of the League of Nations, petitions were made to create an autonomous Kurdish region. Although this effort failed, the events of the Second World War allowed various Kurdish tribes to gain a foothold. This would eventually lead to the Iraqi-Kurdish war, which lasted from 1960 to 1970, resulting in negotiations for the Kurdish-led regions to gain autonomy. However, various policies and the growth of Arabification, especially under Saddam Hussein, led to the loss of many Kurdish lives <a href="E. O'Ballance (1995). The Kurdish Struggle, 1920-94. Palgrave. p. 21.">[2]</a>. <br><br>
                
                After the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the subsequent withdrawal in the late 2010s, many disputes over key oil fields led to further US intervention. In 2017, a referendum was held to fully secede from Iraq, with a 92.73% vote in favor of. However, the Iraqi government retook control of key areas from Kurdistan, causing the vote to be cancelled. Today, Iraqi Kurdistan holds significant economic and political power within Iraq, and is home to Kuridsh refugees from other regions <a href="Philip S. Hadji (September 2015). Iraq Timeline: Since the 2003 War. United States Institute of Peace. 41 (2). https://www.usip.org/publications/2019/07/iraq-timeline-2003-war">[3]</a>.<br><br>
                   
                n summary, the Iraqi Kurdistan region is the most autonomous area of the Greater Kurdistan, and holds a key role in the political, economical, and social aspects of Iraq.
